# LSFoundation

This library contains Swift and Objective-C extensions/categories for making writing code simpler and more expressive.

The creation of this library was inspired by [Soroush Khanlou's talk _You Deserve Nice Things_](https://youtu.be/bsPR0LqetYU), presented at Teki Con 2018. In it, Khanlou makes the case for why adding expressive extensions to your code enables your code to be more readable and writeable, thereby making it easier to write good and maintainable code.

This library is in its infancy, but I plan to add more tricks and extensions as time goes on.
